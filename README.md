# hello-world
Hi everybody! 

I am here to increase my knowledge in IT. I am just curious about this program, so I started. I was a scout in Dsida Jeno scout team. I met there a close friend. He inspired me to start this program, to acquire more information about coding. After these lines I find it highly surprising and interesting.
